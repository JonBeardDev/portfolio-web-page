        <h2>Hello! I'm Jon</h2>
        <p>I am a software developer originally from England, now living in
        the Dallas, TX area.</p>
        <p>As a former educator and instructional designer, I love to create sites
        that are as informative as they are aesthetically pleasing.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!-- External links open in new tab -->
        <p>After graduating from <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk" 
        target="_blank">The University of Birmingham</a> with a Bachelor's in Computer 
          Science, circumstances, including a move to the US precluded me from pursuing
          a career as a developer. I spent many years as a 5th grade teacher of Math 
          and Science, but the COVID-19 pandemic made me re-evaluate my career choices.
        </p>
        <p>Strangely enough, it was through creating formulas and macros on a Google 
          Sheet to track movie ratings that made me realize where my true passion lies.
          As a student at <a href="http://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>
          I am enjoying my return to the world of coding. Better late than never, right?
        </p>
        <p>If I'm not working on code, you'll typically find me solving puzzles, 
          learning a new craft such as crocheting, or fostering kittens for my local
          animal shelter.</p>
        <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer who is eager to learn and solve
          problems, <a href="#contact">please get in touch</a>!</p>
